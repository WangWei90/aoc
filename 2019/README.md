# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions for [2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019/). Back at it with [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/)!

The code isn't polished at all, mind you. I'm usually going for the leaderboard, not the optimal or most elegant solution.

| Day | Notes |
|---|-------|
| 1 | A good easy start. Relearning all the Nim syntax I forgot since last year's AoC... |
| 2 | Brute-forced part 2. Could've probably reused some of the instruction pointer code from last year. |
